# Song Web App Demo Project

## Description
**Author:** Aiden Meikle  
**Date:** 25/11/2020

This Web App is demonstrates a React Based SPA which is used as a Demo for my L4 Uni Tech Workshop Presentation. The purpose is to demonstrate how to Host a Web Application on AWS (this was done using S3), how to interact with a REST API (2 Endpoints on AWS API Gateway) and how that API Gateway integrates with a backend database (DynamoDB).

My wider presentation was on Cloud Computing with AWS and the future directions which encompass Serverless Technologies like AWS Lambda.

**Note:** All of the functionality won't work since the Web App Url is passed in as an environment variable and the service won't be stood up since it was just for demo purpose.


## Running the Web App

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
